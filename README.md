### Project Description:
InQUIZitor is a trivia game that keeps you on the edge of your seat. You have 20 seconds on the clock! For each question answered correctly, you earn a point and an additional 5 seconds on the clock. If you answer incorrectly, you lose a point and 2 seconds on the clock. Reach 10 points before time runs out for a celebratory congratulation! 

### Technologies:
This is a full CRUD single page application built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (noSQL), Mongoose, Javascript Extension (JSX). The EDIT and DELETE features were intentionally disabled to prevent deletion of questions in the database. All gamers are welcome to add questions into the database by using the create feature!
